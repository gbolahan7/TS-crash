// This is a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates variable declarations and type annotations.
// It declares variables of different types and assigns values to them.

let x: number;
x = 5;

let y: string;
y = "Hello, TypeScript!";
let z: boolean;
z = true;


let result = null; // we don't expect this to have any value i.e explicitly declared something to be empty
